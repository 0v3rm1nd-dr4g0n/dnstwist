dnstwist
========
See what sort of trouble users can get in trying to type your domain name. Find similar-looking domains that adversaries can use to attack you. Can detect fraud, phishing attacks and corporate espionage. Useful as an additional source of targeted threat intelligence.

You are also welcome to see some [example reports](https://github.com/elceef/dnstwist/tree/master/examples).

Features
--------
There are several good reasons to give it a try:

* Wide range of domain fuzzing algorithms
* Resolving domain names to IPv4 and IPv6
* Queries for NS and MX records
* Optional: Evaluating web page similarity with fuzzy hashes
* Optional: GeoIP location information
* Optional: Banner grabbing for HTTP and SMTP services
* Optional: WHOIS lookups for creation and modification date
* Optional: Output in CSV format

Required modules
----------------
If you want *dnstwist* to develop full power, please make sure the following Python modules are present on your system. If missing, *dnstwist* **will still work**, but without many cool features.

* [Python GeoIP](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/GeoIP/)
* [A DNS toolkit for Python](http://www.dnspython.org/)
* [WHOIS](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/whois)
* [Requests: HTTP for Humans](http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest/)
* [ssdeep](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ssdeep)

If running Ubuntu or Debian, you can install dependencies like this:

`$ sudo apt-get install python-dnspython python-geoip python-whois python-requests`

Installation of *ssdeep* module requires a little more effort:

`$ sudo apt-get install build-essential libffi-dev python python-dev python-pip automake autoconf libtool`
`$ sudo BUILD_LIB=1 pip install ssdeep`
