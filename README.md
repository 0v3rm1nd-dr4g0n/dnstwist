dnstwist
========
See what sort of trouble users can get in trying to type your domain name. Find similar-looking domains that adversaries can use to attack you. Can detect fraud, phishing attacks and corporate espionage. Useful as an additional source of targeted threat intelligence.

Features
--------
There are several good reasons to give it a try:

* Wide range of domain fuzzing algorithms
* Resolving domain names to IPv4 and IPv6
* Queries for NS and MX records
* Optional: GeoIP location information
* Optional: Banner grabbing for HTTP and SMTP services
* Optional: WHOIS lookups for creation and modification date
* Optional: Output in CSV format

Required modules
----------------
If you want *dnstwist* to develop full power, please make sure the following Python modules are present on your system. If missing, *dnstwist* **will still work**, but without some cool features.

* [Python GeoIP](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/GeoIP/)
* [A DNS toolkit for Python](http://www.dnspython.org/)
* [WHOIS](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/whois)

If running Ubuntu or Debian, you can install dependencies like this:

`sudo apt-get install python-dnspython python-geoip python-whois`

Demo
----
```
