dnstwist
========

See what sort of trouble users can get in trying to type your domain name.
Find similar-looking domains that adversaries can use to attack you. Can detect
typosquatters, phishing attacks, fraud and corporate espionage. Useful as an
additional source of targeted threat intelligence.

dnstwist takes in your domain name as a seed, generates a list of potential
phishing domains and then checks to see if they are registered.
Additionally it can test if the mail servers from MX record can be used to
intercept e-mails and generate fuzzy hashes of the web pages to see if they are
live phishing sites.

Key features
------------
Just not to waste time there are several pretty good reasons to give it a try:

- Wide range of efficient domain fuzzing algorithms
- Multithreaded job distribution
- Resolves domain names to IPv4 and IPv6
- Queries for NS and MX records
- Evaluates web page similarity with fuzzy hashes to find live phising sites
- Tests if MX host (mail server) can be used to intercept e-mails (espionage)
- Generates additional domain variants using dictionary files
- GeoIP location information
- Grabs HTTP and SMTP service banners
- WHOIS lookups for creation and modification date
- Prints output in CSV format

Running
-------
If you want *dnstwist* to develop full power, please make sure the following
Python modules are present on your system. If missing, *dnstwist* **will still
work**, but without many cool features.

- [A DNS toolkit for Python](http://www.dnspython.org/)
- [Python GeoIP](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/GeoIP/)
- [Python WHOIS](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/whois)
- [Requests: HTTP for Humans](http://www.python-requests.org/)
- [ssdeep Python wrapper](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ssdeep)

If running Ubuntu or Debian, you can install dependencies like this:

```
$ sudo apt-get install python-dnspython python-geoip python-whois python-requests
```

Installation of *ssdeep* module requires just a little bit more effort:

```
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential libffi-dev python-dev python-pip automake autoconf libtool
$ sudo BUILD_LIB=1 pip install ssdeep
```

Now it is fully equipped and ready for action.
